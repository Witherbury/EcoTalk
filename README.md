# EcoTalk
A very old chatbot that I created with a good friend of mine. I might not update this code, because it has essentially turned to stone. A great project that is however, worth continuing. Introducing EcoTalk.

# Context
EcoTalk could tell you jokes, ask riddles, play Rock, Paper, Scissors with you, play a game of cricket, flip a coin and give you a limited amount of responses. A few chunks of the code may be missing. 

# Note 
There may be errors in the code, because it has been recovered from 2019. A few classes aren't present. Feel free to run it or modify it.
